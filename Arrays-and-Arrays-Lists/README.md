# Arrays and Arrays Lists

## Goals:
*To collect elements using arrays and array lists

*To use the enhanced for loop for traversing arrays and array lists

*To learn common algorithms for processing arrays and array lists

*To work with two-dimensional arrays



### Problem Solving Techniques
* Adapting Algorithms
* Discovering Algorithms by Manipulating Physical Objects

 
#### Projects
* [A program that prints the balance of an account after the first, second, and third year. The account has an initial balance of $1,000 and earns 5 percent interest per year.](Section-01-Getting-Started-And-Assessment/email.md)
