# Loops

## Goals:
*To implement while, for, and do loops

*To hand-trace the execution of a program

*To become familiar with common loop algorithms

*To understand nested loops

*To implement programs that read and process data sets

*To use a computer for simulations


### Problem Solving Techniques
* Storyboards

 
#### Projects
* [A program that prints the balance of an account after the first, second, and third year. The account has an initial balance of $1,000 and earns 5 percent interest per year.](Section-01-Getting-Started-And-Assessment/email.md)
