# Recursion

## Goals:
*To learn to “think recursively”

*To be able to use recursive helper methods

*To understand the relationship between recursion and iteration

*To understand when the use of recursion affects the efficiency of an algorithm

*To analyze problems that are much easier to solve by recursion than by iteration

*To process data with recursive structures using mutual recursion



### Problem Solving Techniques
* Thinking Recursively

 
#### Projects
* [A program that prints the balance of an account after the first, second, and third year. The account has an initial balance of $1,000 and earns 5 percent interest per year.](Section-01-Getting-Started-And-Assessment/email.md)
