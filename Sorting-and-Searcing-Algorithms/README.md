# Sorting and Searching Algorithms

## Goals:
*To study several sorting and searching algorithms

*To appreciate that algorithms for the same task can differ widely in performance

*To understand the big-Oh notation

*To estimate and compare the performance of algorithms

*To write code to measure the running time of a program



### Problem Solving Techniques
* Estimating the Running Time of an Algorithm

 
#### Projects
* [A program that prints the balance of an account after the first, second, and third year. The account has an initial balance of $1,000 and earns 5 percent interest per year.](Section-01-Getting-Started-And-Assessment/email.md)
